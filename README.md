# Italify
Work-in-progress Glyphs 3 plugin to create synthetic italics (best for sans-serif designs). Round segments are slanted/rotated according to the balance set with the slider, straight segments are treated automatically.

!!! VERY BUGGY !!!

Please reach out if you know how to best incorporate removal of italic extremes :)
